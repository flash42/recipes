### 5. Oat milk
[Website](https://www.loveandlemons.com/oat-milk/)

**Ingredients**

- 709.76 ml water
- 40.5 g old fashioned rolled oats (certified gluten-free, if needed)
- 7 g maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- pinch of salt

**Directions**

1. Add the water, oats, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt to a high-speed blender and blend briefly, about 20 to 30 seconds, until the mixture looks creamy. Do NOT over-blend, as this will make the consistency more slimy.
2. Pour the blended mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, and tap the sides of the strainer to make sure the liquid strains through. (Don't use a spoon to press the pulp into the sides of the strainer, or the resulting milk will be slimy. This is also why you also don't want to squeeze through a nut milk bag for straining.)
3. For an extra-smooth milk, rinse off the strainer and then pour the milk through it a second time. This will strain out any extra sediment for an super-smooth oat milk.
4. Use the milk right away, or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. This homemade milk will separate when stored, so shake it again before using.
